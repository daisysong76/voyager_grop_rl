### **🚀 Integrating DeepSeek’s Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into Your Multi-Agent AI System**

**DeepSeek’s GRPO (Group-Relative Policy Optimization)** can significantly enhance your **multi-agent system** by improving **collaboration, coordination, and adaptability** among agents. Here’s how you can integrate it into **each agent’s workflow** to optimize **reasoning, planning, and execution** in your **open-ended game environment**.

## **🔹 How GRPO Enhances Your Multi-Agent System**
✅ **Group-Aware Decision Making** – Agents learn policies that adapt to the collective state.  
✅ **Dynamic Coordination** – Agents reason jointly, refining plans based on shared goals.  
✅ **Self-Improving Behaviors** – Uses **self-reflection** and **adaptive learning** to refine actions.  
✅ **Hierarchical Multi-Agent Planning** – Breaks down complex, multi-agent tasks into subgoals.

## **🔹 GRPO Integration for Each Agent**
Here’s how **each agent** in your system can leverage GRPO:

### **1️⃣ Vision Agent - Group-Aware Perception & Planning**
🔹 **Current Role:** Provides **spatial insights**, **pathfinding**, and **Tree of Thought (ToT) reasoning**.  
🔹 **GRPO Enhancement:**  
   - **Multi-Agent Vision Fusion:** Share **spatial knowledge** across agents to **optimize movement and task selection**.  
   - **Dynamic Task Coordination:** Prioritize **goals collaboratively** (e.g., if Agent A sees an obstacle, Agent B updates the path).  
   - **Group-Relative ToT Reasoning:** Agents collectively **evaluate spatial structures** for better construction and resource gathering.  

🔹 **Implementation Steps:**  
   ✅ Use **self-attention mechanisms** in Transformer-based models to **merge vision embeddings from multiple agents**.  
   ✅ Incorporate **message-passing** for agents to **broadcast environmental updates**.  
   ✅ Implement **vision-aligned GRPO policies** to **adjust agent positions dynamically**.

### **2️⃣ Curriculum Agent - Multi-Agent Adaptive Learning**
🔹 **Current Role:** Generates **dynamic tasks** based on **vision insights** to maximize exploration.  
🔹 **GRPO Enhancement:**  
   - **Joint Skill Progression:** Agents **coordinate skill learning**, avoiding redundant actions.  
   - **Hierarchical Task Decomposition:** Assign **subtasks based on group optimization** (e.g., if mining wood, split roles into cutters & carriers).  
   - **Self-Organizing Teams:** Agents **self-assign tasks** to maximize **group efficiency** dynamically.

🔹 **Implementation Steps:**  
   ✅ Develop **GRPO-based reward signals** where **group rewards** guide task selection.  
   ✅ Implement **group-aware reinforcement learning (RL)** for **progressive learning adjustments**.  
   ✅ Use **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** to **model inter-agent dependencies** in skill development.

### **3️⃣ Action Agent - GRPO-Based Coordination & Execution**
🔹 **Current Role:** Executes **long-term, complex actions** with iterative refinement.  
🔹 **GRPO Enhancement:**  
   - **Group-Relative Action Selection:** Instead of **individual planning**, actions **consider team coordination**.  
   - **Self-Reflective Execution:** After performing tasks, agents **critique group strategies** and refine decisions.  
   - **Multi-Agent Skill Transfer:** Agents **share action experience** to optimize **long-term planning**.

🔹 **Implementation Steps:**  
   ✅ Modify **policy selection** so that an agent’s **action choices depend on peer actions**.  
   ✅ Implement **multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)** where **agents maximize collective efficiency**.  
   ✅ Utilize **Transformer-based memory models** to **track & update execution history** for improvement.

### **4️⃣ Critic Agent - GRPO-Driven Task Evaluation**
🔹 **Current Role:** Evaluates **task success** and provides **feedback** for improvement.  
🔹 **GRPO Enhancement:**  
   - **Collaborative Evaluation:** Multiple agents assess **task outcomes**, leading to **teamwide strategy refinements**.  
   - **Hierarchical Multi-Agent Criticism:** Agents break down **errors into root causes**, refining **future policies**.  
   - **Cross-Agent Learning:** Feedback improves **not just individual**, but **group-wide performance**.  

🔹 **Implementation Steps:**  
   ✅ Use **DeepSeek’s reward modeling approach** to **optimize group feedback signals**.  
   ✅ Implement **adaptive confidence scoring** where agents **weigh each other’s critiques**.  
   ✅ Integrate **GRPO-based learning feedback loops** to **continuously refine agent strategies**.

---
### **5️⃣ Multi-Bot System - Distributed Coordination via GRPO**
🔹 **Current Role:** Manages **multiple agents** in the **same environment**, coordinating tasks.  
🔹 **GRPO Enhancement:**  
   - **Decentralized Decision-Making:** Agents communicate **state changes & tasks autonomously**.  
   - **Distributed Resource Management:** Optimizes **task allocation** based on **GRPO-driven prioritization**.  
   - **Multi-Agent Adaptation:** If one bot fails, others **dynamically redistribute tasks**.  

🔹 **Implementation Steps:**  
   ✅ Implement **multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)** with **GRPO-inspired shared policies**.  
   ✅ Use **self-organizing task management** where agents update **group-level objectives**.  
   ✅ Enable **real-time agent collaboration** through **state-sharing architectures**.

## **🛠️ Example: GRPO Implementation for Action Agent**
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.distributions import Categorical

class GRPOActionAgent(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_dim=512, num_actions=64):
        super().__init__()
        self.policy_network = nn.Linear(state_dim, num_actions)
        self.value_network = nn.Linear(state_dim, 1)

    def forward(self, state):
        action_logits = self.policy_network(state)
        action_probs = torch.softmax(action_logits, dim=-1)
        return action_probs

    def compute_grpo_loss(self, action_probs, rewards):
        relative_advantage = rewards - rewards.mean()
        loss = -torch.sum(action_probs * relative_advantage)
        return loss

# Example: Selecting Actions with GRPO
agent = GRPOActionAgent()
state = torch.randn(512)
action_probs = agent(state)
action_dist = Categorical(action_probs)
action = action_dist.sample()
```

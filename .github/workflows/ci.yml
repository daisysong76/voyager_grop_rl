name: CI Pipeline for AI Agent
# TODO: A basic CI pipeline that performs the following steps:
#   Pulls the latest code.
#   Sets up the environment.
#   Installs dependencies.
#   Runs tests (optional).
#   Trains or loads the AI model.

# This runs the workflow every time code is pushed to the repository
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    # Step 1: Check out the code from the GitHub repository
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    # Step 2: Set up Python environment
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.10'

    # Step 3: Install dependencies (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face, etc.)
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Optional Step: Install Docker (if you're using containers)
    # Uncomment if you want to build Docker images
    # - name: Install Docker
    #   run: |
    #    sudo apt-get update
    #    sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

    # Step 4: Run tests (if you have tests)
    # Ensure that all tests pass before proceeding to model training
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        pytest tests/  # Assuming your tests are in a folder named "tests"

    # Step 5: Train or Load AI Model
    # Add your script to train the model or load a pre-trained model
    - name: Train or Load AI Model
      run: |
        python train.py  # Replace this with the actual script that trains or loads the model

    # Step 6: Save artifacts or results (optional)
    # Save model checkpoints or any other output data
    - name: Save model artifacts
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: model-checkpoints
        path: ./models/  # Assuming your model outputs to the "models" directory

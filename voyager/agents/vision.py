# Vision Agent: Optimizing Perception-Based Decisions
# Current Voyager Issue: The Vision Agent captures spatial and scene data, but reasoning about it may lack optimization.
# GRPO Enhancement:
# The Vision Agent samples multiple interpretations of the environment and ranks them based on group-relative comparisons.
# More accurate vision-based decision-making emerges through this self-correcting mechanism.
# Example: The Vision Agent sees lava → generates multiple movement strategies → ranks them based on long-term safety & exploration efficiency.

# Roadmap Summary:
# Build a Hierarchical Multi-Agent System for efficient task allocation and execution.
# Incorporate Multi-Modal Perception for richer environmental understanding.
# Enable Dynamic Role Allocation to improve collaboration and adaptability.
# Add Long-Term Memory to leverage past experiences.
# Leverage LLMs for advanced planning and reasoning.
# Introduce Error Handling Mechanisms to improve robustness.
# Fine-Tune Vision Models for better spatial reasoning.
# Simulate Scalable Experiments to stress-test the system.

# By implementing these steps, you can push the boundaries of multi-agent navigation systems and potentially achieve breakthroughs in embodied AI.

# TODO 3: Enhance Long-Term Memory and Knowledge Sharing
    # Current Challenge: Lack of memory limits agents’ ability to learn from past experiences.
    # Solution:
    # Add a multi-modal memory system to store successful strategies and environmental data (e.g., locations, paths, patterns).
    # Use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to reference this memory during task execution.
    # Potential Breakthrough: Allows agents to reuse strategies and adapt to repetitive or complex tasks faster.


    # Use Large Language Models (LLMs) with Structured Fine-Tuning
    # Current Challenge: Limited reasoning capabilities in generating action plans.
    # Solution:
    # Fine-tune LLMs like GPT-4 to generate context-aware, multi-agent action plans.
    # Add specialized modules (e.g., planner, describer, critic) for interpreting visual cues and generating collaborative instructions.
    # Potential Breakthrough: Enhances planning and reasoning capabilities, making agents capable of solving unseen tasks effectively.

    # Introduce Proactive Error Handling and Adaptation
    # Current Challenge: Agents often fail when unexpected errors or environmental changes occur.
    # Solution:
    # Implement closed-loop feedback mechanisms to detect and correct errors autonomously.
    # Add a simulation layer for agents to test potential actions before execution.
    # Potential Breakthrough: Reduces task failure rates and increases the robustness of the system in unpredictable environments.

    # Optimize Vision Models for Navigation Tasks
    # Current Challenge: Vision models may lack the fine-tuned ability to detect and interact with Minecraft-specific objects.
    # Solution:
    # Train or fine-tune a vision transformer (e.g., Swin, CLIP) on Minecraft datasets.
    # Implement spatial reasoning modules to compute relative positions (x, y, z) and accessibility.
    # Potential Breakthrough: Enhances object detection and spatial reasoning, making agents more efficient in navigation.

    # Simulate Scalable Experiments
    # Current Challenge: Limited testing scenarios may not reveal the true potential or weaknesses of the system.
    # Solution:
    # Use procedurally generated Minecraft environments with varying levels of complexity.
    # Simulate large-scale collaboration tasks with 10+ agents to test scalability and adaptability.
    # Potential Breakthrough: Demonstrates real-world viability and provides insights for further optimization.

    # Publish and Benchmark Against State-of-the-Art
    # Current Challenge: It's unclear how your system compares to existing frameworks like HAS, Voyager, and STEVE.
    # Solution:
    # Conduct benchmarks on open-ended navigation tasks (e.g., map exploration, multi-modal goal search) using your enhanced system.
    # Publish results comparing your system's efficiency, success rates, and scalability.
    # Potential Breakthrough: Establishes credibility in the research community and identifies areas for improvement.

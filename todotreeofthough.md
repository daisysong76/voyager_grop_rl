### **Step-by-Step Guide to Integrate Tree of Thought into Vision and Curriculum Agents**

---

### **1. Vision Agent - Tree of Thought Integration**

#### **Purpose**  
- Enhance spatial reasoning and visual analysis.  
- Dynamically update strategies and pathfinding decisions based on multi-step evaluation.

#### **Steps**

**Step 1: Define Thought Nodes**  
- Represent spatial observations as **nodes** capturing object types, positions, and relationships.

```python
class VisionThoughtNode:
    def __init__(self, task, state, score=0):
        self.task = task  # E.g., 'Find nearest tree'
        self.state = state  # E.g., {'position': (5, 7), 'object': 'tree'}
        self.score = score  # Confidence or quality of decision
        self.children = []
```

**Step 2: Generate Thought Tree**  
- Expand thoughts by simulating alternate paths based on visual data.  

```python
def expand_vision_tree(node, depth, vision_data):
    if depth == 0:
        return
    for obj in vision_data:
        # Simulate alternate paths based on visual relationships
        new_state = {'position': obj['position'], 'object': obj['type']}
        child = VisionThoughtNode(f"Move to {obj['type']}", new_state, score=0)
        node.children.append(child)
        expand_vision_tree(child, depth - 1, vision_data)
```

**Step 3: Evaluate Paths**  
- Use scoring metrics like proximity, accessibility, or visibility.

```python
def evaluate_vision_tree(node):
    if not node.children:
        return node.score
    return max(evaluate_vision_tree(child) for child in node.children)
```

**Step 4: Update Strategy**  
- Select the optimal path and dynamically update the agent's plan.

```python
def select_best_path(node):
    if not node.children:
        return [node.task]
    best_child = max(node.children, key=evaluate_vision_tree)
    return [node.task] + select_best_path(best_child)
```

### **2. Curriculum Agent - Tree of Thought Integration**

#### **Purpose**  
- Plan hierarchical subtasks by exploring multiple reasoning paths.  
- Optimize exploration tasks through recursive evaluation and feedback.

#### **Steps**

**Step 1: Define Task Nodes**  
- Model tasks as hierarchical nodes to allow multi-step planning.

```python
class CurriculumThoughtNode:
    def __init__(self, task, state, score=0):
        self.task = task  # E.g., 'Gather wood'
        self.state = state  # E.g., {'inventory': 'axe', 'location': (3, 5)}
        self.score = score  # Task success likelihood
        self.children = []
```

**Step 2: Expand Task Tree**  
- Generate subtasks recursively based on the environment and current state.

```python
def expand_curriculum_tree(node, depth, env_data):
    if depth == 0:
        return
    subtasks = ["Gather wood", "Build shelter", "Mine stone"]
    for subtask in subtasks:
        new_state = simulate_task_state(node.state, subtask)
        child = CurriculumThoughtNode(subtask, new_state, score=0)
        node.children.append(child)
        expand_curriculum_tree(child, depth - 1, env_data)
```

**Step 3: Evaluate Reasoning Paths**  
- Assess task paths and compute scores based on resource availability and task feasibility.

```python
def evaluate_curriculum_tree(node):
    if not node.children:
        return node.score
    return max(evaluate_curriculum_tree(child) for child in node.children)
```

**Step 4: Optimize Task Sequences**  
- Select the highest-scoring task sequence dynamically.

```python
def select_best_task(node):
    if not node.children:
        return [node.task]
    best_child = max(node.children, key=evaluate_curriculum_tree)
    return [node.task] + select_best_task(best_child)
```

### **3. Integration with Agents**

#### **Vision Agent Workflow**  
1. Capture **visual data** from the environment.  
2. Build a **thought tree** with multiple paths using spatial relationships.  
3. Evaluate each path and dynamically update the next move.  

#### **Curriculum Agent Workflow**  
1. Generate a **hierarchical task tree** based on environment context.  
2. Explore alternate sequences of tasks through recursive evaluation.  
3. Select the most effective task plan and feed it to the **Action Agent**.

### **4. Benefits of Tree of Thought Integration**

1. **Dynamic Reasoning**  
   - Enables agents to explore multi-step solutions before committing to decisions.  

2. **Task Adaptability**  
   - Adjusts plans in real-time based on changing environments or new observations.  

3. **Scalability**  
   - Supports complex, long-horizon planning tasks without requiring hard-coded rules.
